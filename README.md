In this project, you will use population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. We don’t know the incomes of our customers, but we should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history and locations and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, we want to analyze our inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a correlation between the two.
