In this project, you'll create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC) that combines information from all over the company. Your data model will make it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze which tea beverages sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.
At the end, you will have applied the key concepts of this course to combine and centralize data that was previously siloed, solving a very common issue facing many companies. More importantly, you'll have a solid foundation to build on when it comes to more complex reporting visualization demands, advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models. No matter how large the data models get as your career progresses, the core principles remain the same.
